Donations With A Difference (DWAD) is a registered charity. We run <a href="{% url 'qwad' %}">quizzes</a>, and other events to raise money to
fund our <a href="{% url 'grants' %}">charitable grants</a> that support physical health, mental
health, and education (see our <a href="{% url 'grant_policy' %}">grant-making policy</a> for more
information). In 2015 we achieved our target of raising over £10,000 and, with your help, we aim to
raise in excess of £20,000 in 2016.
